# Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning and Neural Networks

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning models and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Churn prediction helps businesses understand why customers are leaving and enables them to take proactive measures to retain valuable customers. The project involves data preprocessing, building and evaluating machine learning models, and implementing a neural network for prediction.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
   - Normalized/Standardized features to ensure proper model convergence.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Machine Learning Model**:
   - Built a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict customer churn.
   - Evaluated the model using various performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

3. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**:
   - Constructed a feedforward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for churn prediction.
   - Trained the ANN on the preprocessed data, optimized using backpropagation, and used dropout for regularization.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated both models (ML and ANN) based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning models and evaluation metrics
  - `tensorflow/keras` for building the ANN
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization

## Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision**: Measures how many of the predicted positive instances are actually positive.
- **Recall**: Measures how many actual positive instances were predicted correctly.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics.
